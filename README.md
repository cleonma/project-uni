# Movie Management App

A desktop-based Movie Management System built using JavaFX and MySQL. This project focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java GUI principles, and complete database operations to create a user-friendly CRUD system for managing movie records.

## ðŸŽ¥ Features
- Add, edit, and delete
- Responsive UI layout using JavaFX and Scene Builder
- Real-time connection to MySQL database
- Organized code structure using OOP

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Java (JavaFX, JDK 17+)
- MySQL
- Scene Builder
- JDBC

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts Covered
- Java GUI layout & component manipulation
- Event-driven programming (form actions, button clicks)
- OOP practices: encapsulation, inheritance, class structuring
- Database operations via SQL and JDBC (CRUD, connection handling)

## ðŸ§  Subtopics Practiced
- Basic Graphical User Interface
- Component and Layout Manager
- Java GUI Component Manipulation
- Event-Driven Programming
- Database Operation I & II

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a MySQL database with a `movies` and 'users' table
3. Configure JDBC settings in the code
4. Import the project into your Java IDE
5. Build and run the application

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to combine logic (OOP), interface design (GUI), and database programming to create a complete and functional desktop application thatâ€™s both intuitive and practical.
